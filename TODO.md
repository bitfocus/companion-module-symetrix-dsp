## TODO's:

- Reconnect button: This allows you to manually reconnect to the DSP when connection is not established.
- Add a **NOP** (No Operation) command interval to check if connection is still healty. _(This command will make no adjustments to the DSP, but send an **ACK** if a healthy connection is active.)_
